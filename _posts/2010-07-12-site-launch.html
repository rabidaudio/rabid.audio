You might have noticed some changes recently, such as the redesigned logo at the top. I finally made an up-to-date website for RabidAudio. It has a real domain name, too: <a href="http://www.rabidaudio.com/">rabidaudio.com</a>. I'm still trying to get my router to play nice with the server, so it may be a while until the bugs are all ironed out. If you find any, <a href="mailto:webmaster@rabidaudio.com">let me know</a>. The template for the site is CC licensed from <a href="http://www.spyka.net/">spyka.net</a>, the same place I got the template for <a href="http://musicandpiracy.webs.com/">Music and Piracy</a>. Obviously, even with Dreamweaver CS5 (which is amazing, by the way), I am a terrible web designer, so if you have any pointers or want to help me build a better site, shoot me an email or <i>leave a comment</i> (I don't get too many of those).

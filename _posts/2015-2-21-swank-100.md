A few months ago, I released [`swank`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-02-18-swank-stupid-simple-static-webserver %}). I recently
decided that a watching livereload server is a ciritical missing feature. When I went to add it, I saw how awful
my old code was and did a *complete rewrite* in the process.

## Changelog

### Enhancements

- Added a test suite
  - The tests are really slow, because basically each one spawns a process and then makes a network request. There's probably some room for optimization here
- Added watch+livereload
  - This took a suprising amount of packages to accompish:
    - [watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/watch) to watch for file changes
    - [connect-livereload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-livereload) for script insertion
    - [tiny-lr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiny-lr) to act as the reload server
- Better argument parsing with [nopt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nopt)
- Modularized
  - You can now use `swank` as a module with `require()`. Not sure why you'd need to do this, but it's a lot cleaner
- Updated [connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)
  - The new version separated out some common tasks into their own packages
    - [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) for logging
    - [serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static) for serving static files
- [JSHint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jshint)'d
- Using [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org)
- Added terminal [colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors)


### Bug Fixes

- Previously, leaving off a directory did not default to the current working directory as expected

For the longest time, I have been interested in genres. I like thinking about what it is that tells you that a song is reggae and not grunge or dirty south gangsta rap or whatever. Obviously, the easiest way to do this is with math, because math is awesome! I started by thinking about several common genres, and what makes them different. I came up with several dimensional scales with which a genre or artist might fall. I may think of more (and I am open do suggestions!), but here is what I have so far:<br /><br />Focus on Melody vs Focus on Rhythm<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Power Metal vs Dance</span></blockquote>Focus on Lyrics vs Focus on Instrumentation<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Rap vs Classical</span></blockquote>Natural vs. Artificial Instrumentation<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Folk vs Electronic</span></blockquote>Those are the clear cut ones. The others are a little more subjective:<br /><br />Complexity<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Progressive vs Punk</span></blockquote>Aggressiveness<br /><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Blackened Death Metal vs Bubblegum Pop</span></blockquote>The last one may be the hardest to judge, is a lot more subjective, and may be completely unnecessary. I'm looking for a broad genre that would have the same output as a different one, but haven't found one yet. As an either-or (binary system) instead of a scale, this allows for 32 different options, which even for broad genres doesn't seem like enough. I am open for thoughts on this.

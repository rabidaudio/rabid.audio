So here is another mot-music related post, but it has been 2 months with nothing worth mentioning, so I might as well post something.<br /><br />My next project is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearable_computer">wearable computer</a> like those made popular by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mann">Steve Mann</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thad_Starner">others</a>. While I am ashamed to admit where the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/">inspiration came from</a>, the more I thought about it, the more awesome it sounded.<br /><br />I'm starting with a broken Acer Aspire netbook. I found a neat hand-held keyboard from <a href="http://onsources.com">this site that sells really cool shit from China for dirt cheap</a>.<br /><br /><div>Now, I'm working on acquiring a <a href="http://www.myvu.com/c_ev_blackA.html">MyVu Headset</a> I can  modify into a transparent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-mounted_display">HMD</a>.<br /><div><br /><div>I made a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VS-0KEFPOX6gpRPgikRIKvFPhEqF9IaW-GBOZKjW9OI/edit?hl=en&amp;authkey=CM3G5JkK">TODO list</a> for the project. Most of it is silly, unreasonable, etc., but some of it is actually not too difficult, including an <a href="http://www.hoagieshouse.com/IR/">infrared camera for night-vision</a>.<br /></div></div></div>

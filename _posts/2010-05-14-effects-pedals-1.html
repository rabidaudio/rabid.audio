On my last visit to <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/">Radio Shack</a>, I went in for a small PCB, and came out with a bag full of ICs, switches, jacks, and inspiration.<div><br /></div><div>The first idea was thanks to a 555 timer. <a href="http://www.nightwatchmanmusic.com/">Tom Morello</a> and <a href="http://bucketheadland.com/">Buckethead</a> sound awesome with their killswitches, and DIY guitarists <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Guitar-Killswitch-Strat.-design/">love to play with them as well</a>. What if you didn't have to use your strumming had to use the switch? After some <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0ApFJD1eTFlPSdFEySldPY3RvQ3VMOHA4ZG5GR3pLdGc&amp;hl=en">function crunching</a> (I was looking for a circuit that would switch at frequencies from about .5 Hz to about 15 Hz with duty cycles from 25~75, and <a href="http://www.schematica.com/555_Timer_design/555_Timer_Free.htm">this</a> was a big help), I got a design for an Auto-Killswitch. Check out the schematics here (PLEASE NOTE: I have not built it, or even tested it yet, so I cannot yet vouch for it's accuracy). The problem I'm finding now is I can't find anyone who sells 1.5M audio taper pots. Most guitar shops only have up to 1M for humbuckers. Hopefully, I will find some. I could just use 1Ms, but I would lose a lot of duty cycle range for most frequencies. </div><div><br /></div><div><i>Edit (5/17/11): I just looked back at this schematic, and it is very wrong, so I removed the link. I will post a better one in the future. </i></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The second idea is a little less original, but handy nonetheless. During a bout of wishing I had the funds for <a href="http://www.ehx.com/products/deluxe-memory-boy">one of these beauties</a>, I realized it wouldn't be too difficult to make a loop pedal. With some help from <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Looper/">Instructables</a>, I could patch together a loop pedal with 20 seconds of flash memory pretty painlessly. Just need one of these <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2102855#">first</a>. </div><div><br /></div><div>Maybe now that summer is here I will have time to make at least one of these.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>

So I <i>finally</i> have a stable server set up. It is an old Gateway that came with Win98 (and a 450MHz processor, no less!) that is now running <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian 6.0</a> and <a href="http://apache.org/">Apache2.2</a>. A friend turned me on to <a href="http://webmin.com/">Webmin</a>, which screwed up my Virtual host settings, but otherwise has been a godsend. It also hosts a headless <a href="http://transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> client,  and when a file completes, I move it to <a href="http://dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>. This gets around the school's firewall, which frowns on p2p.<div>This was perfect timing, as BCAR, the alternate realities club on campus, came to me asking about starting a website for their convention April 22, KinatsuCon. Unfortunately, No one had any web design experience, and I am awful at the creative portion of web design, so I did what has become habit for me: I downloaded a CC-licensed template from <a href="http://spyka.net/">spyka.net</a> (this time it was "widget"), and got to work. Assuming we get some content, we may actually get a domain name, but for now, you can see the content-less site at <a href="http://kinatsucon.dyndns.org/">kinatsucon.dyndns.org</a>.</div><div>This also gave me the excuse to set up an FTP server (so people can keep the site updated). It was surprisingly easy to set up vsftpd, and works well.</div><div><br /></div><div>In music-related news, we've finally got a band together (that is, we found a drummer), and can hopefully compete in the Battle of the Bands this Saturday (April 2). </div>

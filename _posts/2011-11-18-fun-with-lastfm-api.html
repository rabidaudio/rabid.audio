I am currently writing a program in python (using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pylast/">pylast</a>) to&nbsp;analyze&nbsp;my last.fm plays and other data. I'm not sure currently everything I want it to do, but I would eventually like something that will chart plays over time for artists, tags, or all tracks over time. Normally, I wouldn't have posted something on it now, but to get my API access credentials from last.fm, I need to link to a site, so I will update this post as the project develops.<br />Music and Math ftw.<br /><a href="http://www.last.fm/api/account">http://www.last.fm/api/account</a><br /><br /><b>EDIT</b>: Here is my first Project: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2013-05-12-lastfm-api-genre-influences %}" target="_blank">Tag percentages</a><br /><br />

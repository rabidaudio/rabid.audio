I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14845177">this article</a> from a couple months ago in <a href="http://www.economist.com/">The Economist</a> entitled "How to Sink Pirates" (the article is "Primium Content" on their website,<b>** </b>but if you are on the Berry College intranet, you can read it <a href="http://ucheck.berry.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=45197592&amp;site=ehost-live">here</a>). In it, the author argues that the "best way to discourage it is to offer a diverse range of attractive, legal alternatives." However, the author suggests that these alternatives are things like dollar songs on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes Music Store</a>. But <a href="http://www.delvianrecords.com/onesheets/Billboard.pdf">35% goes straight to Apple</a>. The other 65% goes to the Record Label. <a href="http://www.negativland.com/albini.html">The actual artist sees very little of that</a>.<br /><br /><i>**<b>EDIT</b> (10/8/11): I find this really ironic. See <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/free-science-one-paper-at-a-time-2/all/1">this</a> for the DRM-free revolution equivalent of academia articles.</i><br /><div><br /><div>In other news, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/incontiplexion">IncontipleXion</a> competed at the Battle of The Bands at <a href="http://www.spx.org/">St. Pius X</a> Catholic School in Atlanta. If you were there, I hope you had a good time; I know we did. The winners were a progressive dethcore band, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thisnightipossess">This Night I Possess</a>. They were absolutely amazing. If you're into that kind of music, check them out. And one last thing, I am in the process of putting together a hardcore industrial/experimental group under the name <a href="http://www.myspace.com/crimsondominionband">Crimson Dominion</a>. I've got a few songs written, so if anyone is interested it joining, toss me an email.</div></div><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lxDnsHMhemU/S8z9o0fyi6I/AAAAAAAAAGU/VfUzOSN03p8/s1600/logo2.png"><img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5462019325822143394" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_lxDnsHMhemU/S8z9o0fyi6I/AAAAAAAAAGU/VfUzOSN03p8/s200/logo2.png" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; display: block; height: 78px; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: left; width: 200px;" /></a>

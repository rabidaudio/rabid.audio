{% include post_specific/2014-film.html %}

February marks one year of [recording everything I watch in a spreadsheet](https://www.facebook.com/rabidsnakemonkey/posts/10152176782109330). The full data, including date, format, and who I watched it with (if applicable), is available [on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CLgneANQp1ucZZBqDfCDZHjxMgJfXl6JnwWbLjBCxbo/edit?usp=sharing), but here are some statistics and highlights, because why not.

In total there were 100 films, as well as 9 seasons of televison shows (which I'm removing from this analysis). This leaves an even 100 films, which is convenient for percentages.

In the future, I'm going to add a column for year, add separate language and country columns, and also separate out 'watched with' and television versus film. I might even whip up a little Rails app to enter faster. Then other people can record their watches too. If you'd be interested in this, let me know. In the meantime, [here's the list for 2015](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ibICLXrjEgaeJ9eqTT9_fsSevKGm949FUklkmBn4xmo/edit?usp=sharing).

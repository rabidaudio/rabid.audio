So after checking out <a href="http://bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a> (which you should do, too if you've never heard of it), I stumbled across the Bible of music piracy; basically exactly what I have been saying this whole time (but much better written). It's &nbsp;a blog called&nbsp;<a href="http://newmusicstrategies.com/">New Music Strategies</a>&nbsp;by Andrew Dubber (et al.).<br />In one particular article,&nbsp;"Should I be worried about piracy," he starts by separating <i>piracy</i> from <i>unauthorized copying </i>and then points out how the latter is not a problem worth worrying about.<br />In <a href="http://newmusicstrategies.com/2007/03/19/thing-2-hear-like-buy/">another</a>, he talks about how important it is for people to be able to listen to music before purchasing.<br />This will sound cheesy, but the information age really is revolutionizing the music industry (for the better, IMO).

The loop pedal didn't really work out. Radioshack made a newer version of <a href="http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2102855">the device</a>, which is surface-mount and has a different circuit, so making it loop is much more complicated. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaypee4227/2158771745/">You could use a relay system</a>, but honestly the quality of the recording is so bad that it was not worth finishing. I haven't yet had the chance to go out and get the parts for the killswitch.<div><br /></div><div>In other news, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/incontiplexion">IncontipleXion</a> is considering a name change. You can vote for the new name<a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dGIyUHFQek9OQmtJMXJXXzFuX2tUSmc6MQ"> here</a>. </div>

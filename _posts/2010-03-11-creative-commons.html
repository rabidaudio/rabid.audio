I'm sure most of you have heard about <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>, (especially if you read my last paper). For those of you who have not:<br /><a href="http://creativecommons.org/about/what-is-cc">Creative Commons</a> is an alternative to Copyright, similar to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU Licence</a>, where you can choose what others can and cannot legally do with your work. Consider this idea applied to music. Piracy is no longer an issue, as you can (and are encouraged) to distribute such work.<br />For an example of such a licence, check the bottom of this page.

# Custom Eurorack Synth modules

This is a collection of custom synthesizer modules designed around the Eurorack standard.

The goal is to design these from scratch; I can use textbook and datasheet example circuits, and I can look at other circuits for ideas and inspiration, but I'm not cloning an existing circuit but instead coming up with my own designs.

This project is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/rabidaudio/synthesizer). The repository goes back quite a long way, evolving out of coursework from GT ECE 4893 Analog Circuits for Music Synthesis with Dr. Lanterman.

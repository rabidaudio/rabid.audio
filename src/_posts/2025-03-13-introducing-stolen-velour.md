I've started a new band! We're called [Stolen Velour](https://stolenvelour.music) (a play on "stolen valor", "velour" is velvet fabric). My friend Emmaline and I are "co-fronting" the band. We each bring our own songs and sing lead on them, with the other playing lead guitar. This dynamic might not work forever but for now it's suiting us pretty well. My songs tend to be sad girl slowcore/emo songs while hers tend to be a blend of indie rock and shoegaze. We're calling it "grungy lovewave."

Our first demo is one of mine, it's called "floorboards" and you can hear it below. Our next one is one of Em's and it's very catchy. We plan to drop an EP this spring.

I've also created a record label to put out music, [Killian Street Records](https://killianstreet.bandcamp.com). I had planned on doing this for a while, assigning [Chris Kraemer's first EP](https://chriskraemer.bandcamp.com/album/killian-street-sessions) which I produced as `KST-001` and [my solo folk EP](https://serioustimes.bandcamp.com/album/sparkle-girl) as `KST-002`. The label will let me use one account for DistroKid and manage multiple Bandcamp and Shopify pages.

I've been working on some new material for Serious Times also, which should be out later this year.

All in all, lots of music happening. I'm so happy I get to do this~

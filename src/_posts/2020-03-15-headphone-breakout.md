[35RAPC4BHN3](/resources#35RAPC4BHN3) is a very common Stereo 3.5mm jack, you can even find them on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XX9ZPZM) if you don't want to wait for shipping from a more traditional parts supplier. This jack has connection switches for both tip and sleeve. However the layout of the pins is not conducive to using on a breadboard.

I put together a small breakout board for it and printed them via OSHPark.

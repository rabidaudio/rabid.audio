title: Albums of the Year - 2022
---

Another year of music. This year I was pretty good at keeping up with my [spreadsheet of new releases](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dLhu-120tJHJzHT6CEy0gorkQybDrpcy59h1p4iJHk/edit?usp=sharing#gid=1122242034) up until about September, at which point I'm still a bit behind. But since time's running out, I'm finalizing my choices for the year now anyway.

This summer was espcially great, with almost all of the top ones coming from April through August. Notably, we got Horse Jumper of Love and Bartees Strange on the same day in June, and then Beach Bunny and Pool Kids on the same day in July.

This year, I decided to separate full-length releases from everything else (EPs, splits, comps, etc), just because it was really hard to compare some of these.

# Listening report

Naturally Spotify reports mostly "Bubblegrunge" and emo. Their numbers don't mean much though; this year I managed drastically reduce my Spotify usage, listening primarily from VLC, Bandcamp, and physical media. I'd love see do a breakdown, but I'm afraid Last.fm doesn't share which app/service submitted a scrobble.

Last.fm should post [my annual look back](https://www.last.fm/user/rabidaudio/listening-report/year) a few days into the new year, at which point I'll update this with the most interesting findings.

# AOTY Past years

For fun, since I haven't actually posted it in a while, here are some past year's lists also:

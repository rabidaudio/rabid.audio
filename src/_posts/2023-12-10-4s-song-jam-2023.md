title: Fourth Strike Song Jam 2023
---

Every year, [Fourth Strike](https://fourth-strike.bandcamp.com/) (the record label/not-for-profit music collective behind [the garages](https://thegarages.bandcamp.com/)) does a little community song jam. Participants are encouraged to make one song a week for for weeks. Each week has a theme and some optional additional challenges. It's a fun, low-pressure environment to practice making music.

This year I did my best to participate consistently. I've put the results on [Bandcamp](https://serioustimes.bandcamp.com), with the more post-rock songs under Serious Times and the more twee emo songs under a new name, Slow Church.

## Week 1: PHONE IT IN

> CHALLENGE: The title of your song must be the name of one of your "most used" emojis
> 
> BONUS CHALLENGE: Oops, your phone is running out of storage. Better make the song shorter than 1m 59s!


For week one, I made a little spoken word piece which was what I'd wished I'd said during some mildly transphobic incident (basically a shower argument), and placed it over some sloppy twangly midwest emo guitar. Trying to to channel [american poetry club](https://discounteddanceparties.bandcamp.com/album/a-little-light-of-our-own) or something like that. It's cringingly twee.

## Week 2: ART HEIST

> CHALLENGE: For this week's inspiration, we're breaking into a modern art gallery. Your inspiration are the two pieces of artwork below - feel free to take inspiration from one or both of them however you like!
>
> - [Yellow, Cherry, Orange by Mark Rothko](https://www.wikiart.org/en/mark-rothko/yellow-cherry-orange)
>
> - [Surrealism on TV by Robert Heinecken](https://hammer.ucla.edu/collections/ucla-artists-in-the-hammer-museum-collections/art/surrealism-on-tv)
> 
> BONUS CHALLENGE: Good artists copy, great artists steal. Incorporate one or both of the "Bonus Sample" audio files [in the folder below](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h-Es4WGtNWn6Jo5QQn64dFlYJU_VkIlw) - you may edit, sample, or rerecord them however you like

The Rothko gave me vibes like the sun, oppressive brightness and heat in a desert or something like that. Meanwhile the second sample is like a de-tuned drone in the Bb/C range that felt similarly oppressive. I decided to detune the instruments to match that sample pitch, and write a chord progression that utilized that pitch somewhere in each chord, keeping it droning through the song.

I added some processing to the sample, and layered in a heavily processed sound of bowing a de-tuned low B on a 5 string electric bass. Added some high-reverb guitar feedback, some Ah's (thanks to my partner Kathryn for singing), synth strings, and some sax (both a pretty doubling of the string part and some frantic squealy playing and mouthpiece noises, thanks to my friend John). [Another friend](https://parallax.fyi/) really outdid themselves with this insane drum part, which really caries an otherwise kinda boring track.

## Week 3: I LIKE YOUR STYLE

> CHALLENGE: Hey new friend! Collaborate with someone you haven't collaborated before.
> 
> BONUS CHALLENGE: Make your song "in the style of" another artist - a fellow jammer, a famous musical act, your mate jim, anyone!

I had plans to do a song in the style of Modest Mouse with a friend. We had some good ideas but were both too busy and nothing ever materialized. But I did finally finish a song I had written back in June, unreleated to the song jam.

## Week 4: GOLDEN RECORD

> CHALLENGE: There is an alien, somewhere. Or an astronaut, waiting. You'll never reach them, but you could broadcast. We're making a new ["Golden Record"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) What are you going to send?
> 
> BONUS CHALLENGE: The space boffins really don't want to waste any space on this disc - make it as long as you like, but make it count! Your song must be through-composed (no repeated sections).
> 
> BONUS BONUS CHALLENGE: Humanity is at its best when we work together: have each track or instrument be performed/recorded/made by a separate person.

I ended up not doing a song of my own for this week either, but I did contribute a string bass part to someone else's song. If it ends up online I'll post it here.

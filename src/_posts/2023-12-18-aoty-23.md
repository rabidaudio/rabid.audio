2023 has been a great year in my personal life, and an appropriately strong year for music as well. This year I converted my spreadsheet of new releases into a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) app, along with [a script to import releases from Bandcamp and Spotify](https://github.com/rabidaudio/notion-import-record). Even still I've been hit or miss with keeping up with new releases. Here are my favorites of the year. This is just the top 10, I decided not to include records that I liked but didn't listen to enough to stand strongly by.

Also check out my [list from last year]({% link _posts/2022-12-22-aoty.md %}).

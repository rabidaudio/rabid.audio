title: Modest Mouse cover
---

I bought a new guitar today. It's a budget instrument, a Chinese-made [Alvarez AF30CE](https://alvarezguitars.com/guitar/af30ce/) which I got from [Maple Street Guitars](https://www.maplestreetguitars.com/). Nothing to write home about, but I think it sounds pretty good for what it is. It's got a little pickup with an integrated tuner, which is really nice.

I started [a document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BEAfFYWayn878wMqsEY9xT3BromaxvqmTYKdC9yzOF4/edit?usp=sharing) with my acoustic repertoire: lyrics, chords, and notes.

To celebrate, I recorded a cover of Modest Mouse's "Bankrupt on Selling." It's the song I play instinctively when I pick up a guitar, ever since I learned it back in college. I put way too much compression and reverb on the vocals here because I can't sing. Don't judge too harshly!

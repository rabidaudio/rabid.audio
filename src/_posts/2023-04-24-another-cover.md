I've been playing [my new guitar]({% link _posts/2023-02-19-modest-mouse-cover.md %}) basically every day since I got it. Seriously my Jazz bass is feeling unloved.

Today I recorded another song I've been playing constantly. It's from [a white-boy emo Soundcloud rap group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GothBoiClique) lol. You can [listen to the original here](https://open.spotify.com/track/7MadgpP9SWuQgvsNJkeiaf?si=db1c87643fa94ddf). Content warning: drug use, self-harm, thoughts of suicide. That makes it sound really intense, but it's pretty cheesy. I love a keyed harmonica; it's fun to play and you literally can't play a wrong note.

    notes: >
      I don't like using these. They have weird voltage requirements, and
      when the switch is off they connect the output to VSS (which is the
      negative rail in most dual-ended power supply circuits). I prefer
      the [DG403](#DG403).

    description: General purpose JFET Operational Amplifier (Op-amp)
    notes: >
      This is my go-to op-amp. Solid, easy to use, audio quality.
      Comes in single, dual, and quad packages. Note that the power supply pins
      on the TL074 are opposite what you'd expect!

      They don't make good comparators because they aren't rail-to-rail, and they
      have pretty high power supply requirements so they may not be usable in all
      situations.

    notes: >
      Given a power input, these will output a stable voltage half-way between them.
      This is very useful for creating dual-ended power supplies needed for most op-amp
      circuits in situations where your power supply is limited (e.g. a 9V stompbox).

    notes: >
      These are very easy to find. They are stereo with plug switches for both tip and sleeve.
      I've designed [a breakout board for these](https://github.com/rabidaudio/synthesizer/tree/master/hp_breakout).
      However I've started to prefer the Thonkiconn jacks instead as they are vertical
      and match the Alpha 9mm pot height.

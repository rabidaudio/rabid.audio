this is going to get pretty abstract<br /><br />engineer: think about everything in terms of prjects<br /><br />creating a startup - goal is to great a process (basically a function) that takes in inputs (customers, income, materials, time, hard work) and returns outputs (products, revenue) of a higher value.<br /><br />that's what all engineering is: creating a black box whose outputs are more valuable than their inputs<br /><br />creating a relationship- goal is to create a process inputs(people, time, emotional engagement) ouputs(happiness, experience, emotional attachment)<br /><br /><br />growth and scale of black boxes should be iterative<br /><br /><br />from that respect, I think it is fair to analyze previous relationships as startups<br /><br /><br />differences: customers and producers are one and the same (happens for things that aren't companies all the time)<br /><br />scale too fast?<br />sufficient customer discovery?<br />loss of vision?<br /><br /><br />take process of failure to heart<br />maybe too much so<br />agile process of failing quickly causes me to underestimate projects successfulness<br />expectation that project will fail requires willingness to be proven wrong<br /><br />my relationship experience is still pretty new (but admittedly more experienced than with startups)<br />one was an obvious failure - which I dragged out<br />other was a moderate success<br /><br />when growth levels out (or goes negative), engineer's work is done<br />if final point is not sustainable, failure. take learning and move to next project<br />if final point is sustainable, success. problem solved. take learning and move to next project<br /><br />continuous exponential growth is an impossible task for any project, particularly relationships<br /><br />

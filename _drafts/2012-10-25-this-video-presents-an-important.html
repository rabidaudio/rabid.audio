This video presents a an important question: why don't we&nbsp;implement&nbsp;better &nbsp;security systems that we have the technology for? He goes into detail about<br />I was previously unaware that there are ways, using cryptography, to limit information given to exactly what you want to give and nothing else (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yao">Andrew Yao</a> and his&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao's_Millionaires'_Problem">Millionaire's&nbsp;problem</a>).<br />One of the questions Narayanan poses is why companies like Facebook and Google don't&nbsp;implement&nbsp;these. There are some technical and legal answers, but the big one is economic. Those companies have turned their&nbsp;commodity&nbsp;into information. Privacy is then your payment for the service.<br /><br />That got me thinking about how you would create a business or organization that could&nbsp;implement&nbsp;these systems. The most obvious option is to charge people for such services. However, people don't like paying for things like webmail. Also, money transactions, to a certain extent, make keeping privacy more difficult (although bitcoins have helped on that front a lot).<br />Then it&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;to me that everyone has a commodity that is of value to the system that could be traded for the service. Everyone has a&nbsp;reasonably&nbsp;high-end computational device and a small&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of internet bandwidth (they must if they are able to use the service). Once I realized this, the answer was quite clear: distribute the serving of the service among it's users. That is what the whole cyberpunk revolution is about.<br /><br />Let's design systems that distribute serving&nbsp;among it's users. P2P could be used for any type of service; mail, data storage, crypto systems.

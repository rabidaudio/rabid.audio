I'm in the mood to make a top albums list for the year. However, I have a tendency to be a little behind-the-times in terms of music. So here are the top things I've <i>discovered</i> since this time last year. The first group of things have actually come out since September 2013. The other half are new discoveries of older things. In researching this, I discovered that at least three of these artists are on <a href="http://wki.pe/Jagjaguwar" target="_blank">Jagjaguwar</a>. I couldn't bring myself to rank them exactly, so each group is sorted alphabetically by artist. That way you have to listen to all of them!<br /><h3>From this year</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://angelolsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/burn-your-fire2.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://angelolsen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/burn-your-fire2.png" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Burn_Your_Fire_for_No_Witness" target="_blank">Angel Olsen -&nbsp;Burn Your Fire for No Witness</a><br />Sure, this ends up on everyone's top albums for 2014 (or will, when December rolls around), so I won't repeat everyone else's opinions here. Suffice to say, her voice is absolutely haunting. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Burn+Your+Fire+For+No+Witness/9566695" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />CHVRCHES - The Bones of What You Believe<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/20191/homepage_large.8d6ae9ab.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://cdn4.pitchfork.com/albums/20191/homepage_large.8d6ae9ab.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Eagulls" target="_blank">Eagulls - Eagulls</a><br />Post-punk is still going strong in some parts of the world (Leeds, in this case). I first heard these guys on <a href="http://www.avclub.com/video/eagulls-cover-stone-roses-206864" target="_blank">A.V. Undercover doing some fancy trick with a portable fan</a>. Their new album isn't around for streaming anywhere, but you can hear their EP on <a href="http://derangedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/eagulls" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.<br /><br /><br />Foals -<br />I hadn't heard Foals before I stood out in the rain at Shaky Knees this summer. Everyone was cold and soaked to the bone, but everyone was too caught up in the music to notice. At one point, a tarp got dragged over the crowd and a few hundred people all danced together beneath it. I feel back in that moment again when I hear this album. So groovy. Listen<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Artpop_cover.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Artpop_cover.png" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Artpop" target="_blank">Lady Gaga - ARTPOP</a><br />I've been meaning to write a post about why this album is better than <i>Born This Way</i>, but I still haven't gotten around to it. It has more edge, some nice bass lines, and a few spectacular hooks that she uses conservatively, which keep them from wearing out ("Watch <i>me</i> at the pool..."). Also I finally got to see her live on this tour. It isn't on Grooveshark, but I'm sure you can find it somewhere.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/19957/homepage_large.7103f41b.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://cdn.pitchfork.com/albums/19957/homepage_large.7103f41b.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Julia_with_Blue_Jeans_On" target="_blank">Moonface - Julia With Blue Jeans On</a><br />Moonface is the newest solo project of Wolf Parade (see below) singer&nbsp;<a href="http://wki.pe/Spencer_Krug" target="_blank">Spencer Krug</a>. The whole album is just him at a piano, and the pianowork is absolutely astounding, and the lyrics are solid too.&nbsp;<a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Julia+With+Blue+Jeans+On/9308019" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><br />Typhoon - White Lighter<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><h3>Discoveries</h3><div>Cat Power - You Are Free</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Bee_Thousand.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/78/Bee_Thousand.jpg" height="100" width="98" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Bee_Thousand" target="_blank">Guided By Voices - Bee Thousand</a>&nbsp;(1994)<br />Okay, so I'm a decade behind on this one. If you are behind too, this is probably the greatest lo-fi album ever recorded. I got so obsessed with "Tractor Rape Chain" that I played it over and over until my hands were sore. I wonder sometimes if the low production quality hints at more than is actually there, and it is this inference that makes the songs more beautiful. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Bee+Thousand/255231" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.loversarelovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/darklight.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.loversarelovers.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/darklight.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lovers/Dark+Light" target="_blank">Lovers - Dark Light</a>&nbsp;(2010)<br />I'm not sure how such a good band picked such a generic name for both band and album. Anyway, they don't have a Wikipedia article, but I get the impression they are a lesbian indie rock band (in the vein of Tegan and Sara) from the west coast. I heard "Boxer" on the radio in a coffee shop and couldn't get it out of my head. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Dark+Light/5238616" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Mogwairockaction.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/58/Mogwairockaction.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Rock_Action_(album)" target="_blank">Mogwai - Rock Action</a> (2001)<br />This was the first Mogwai album to incorporate more electronic sounds into their music (as with their latest&nbsp;<a href="http://wki.pe/Rave_Tapes" target="_blank">Rave Tapes</a>, which gets an honorable mention below). It also has a lot more vocal parts than usual. This made it a bit divisive with the post-rockers, but in my opinion it is their best. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Rock+Action/182451" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br />The Radio Dept. - Clinging to a Scheme<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Regina_Spektor-Soviet_Kitsch.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Regina_Spektor-Soviet_Kitsch.jpg" height="97" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Soviet_Kitsch" target="_blank">Regina Spektor - Soviet Kitsch</a> (2004)<br />So technically I heard this back around 2011. A friend of mine tried to show it to me, but I didn't really give it a chance. I've realized my mistake now though. This is now my favorite of her albums, although I suspect it is less popular with her "Samson"-loving fans. The uncharacteristic fury of "Your Honor" and the adorable intro for it really make this album, although&nbsp;"Poor Little Rich Boy" is likely the strongest track. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Soviet+Kitsch/166120" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Screaming_Female's_Ugly_album_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/20/Screaming_Female's_Ugly_album_cover.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Ugly_(Screaming_Females_album)" target="_blank">Screaming Females - Ugly</a> (2012)<br />I first heard this New Jersey punk band's track "Expire" on WREK and became obsessed. I can't comprehend how such fury comes from such a small person. And she can absolutely shred. If you don't believe me, check out their <a href="http://www.avclub.com/video/screaming-females-cover-sheryl-crow-73983" target="_blank">cover of Sheryl Crow</a>. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Ugly/7728242" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><br />Sebadoh - Bakesale<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/17384/homepage_large.5bf87fab.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://cdn2.pitchfork.com/albums/17384/homepage_large.5bf87fab.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Sharon_Van_Etten#Tramp" target="_blank">Sharon Van Etten - Tramp</a> (2012)<br />I don't know what to say about this one, except that "Give Out" gets stuck in my head like mad. She had assistance from members of The National, Beirut, and Wye Oak, so it must be good. <a href="http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Tramp/7267735" target="_blank">Listen</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Slowdive - Alison<br /><br />Wolf Parade - Apologies to the Queen Mary<br /><br />Yo La Tengo -<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Wye_Oak_-_Civilian_album_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Wye_Oak_-_Civilian_album_cover.jpg" height="100" width="100" /></a></div><a href="http://wki.pe/Civilian_(Wye_Oak_album)" target="_blank">Wye Oak - Civilian</a> (2011)<br />I haven't been this obsessed with an album in a very long time.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Honorable Mentions<br /><br />Galaxie 500 -<br />Kendrick Lamar - good kid, m.a.a.d. city<br />Mogwai - Rave Tapes<br />The National - Trouble Will Find Me<br />She Keeps Bees<br />This Frontier Needs Heroes
